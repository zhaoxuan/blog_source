Here’s a quick tip for anybody migrating to a MacBook from a Windows machine. If you’re used to navigating documents and web pages by keyboard command, you’ll know that the Pg Up, Pg Down, Home and End buttons don’t exist on a standard Mac keyboard.

So what are the alternatives? Here are four keyboard shortcuts that’ll get you up and running in no time! Basically, you use the “fn” key (bottom left of your keyboard) and the arrow keys on the bottom right. Here are the combinations to use:

    Page Up: fn+up arrow
    Page Down: fn+down arrow
    Home/Top: fn+left arrow
    End/Bottom: fb+right arrow

Enjoy it.
